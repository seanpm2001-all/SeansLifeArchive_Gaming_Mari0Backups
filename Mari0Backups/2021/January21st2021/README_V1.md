# January 21st 2021 Mari0 backup data

This backup was created on January 21st 2021, but the backup is labeled January 22nd 2021. Not much has changed between this backup and the last.

## Install instructions (As of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa)

To get started, you have to have the mari0 snap package installed. If the service still works in the future, try this in your preferred terminal:

`sudo apt install mari0`

I got it from the Ubuntu store, and this command may be a bit dated. If you already have the game installed, make sure you create a backup before overwriting any files.

**⚠️ CAUTION: For data safety, make sure the game isn't running first. ⚠️**

Navigate to: `/home/snap/mari0/current/.local/share/love/mari0/mappacks/smb/`

There should be 53 text files (there could be more or less, depending on how much you have played) of which 52 can be replaced. Make sure to back these files up first if you have any levels here.

Grab all files that start with a number, and avoid `settings.txt` delete them, and place the new files that start with a number `1-1` etc. here. 

Now load up the game, and enjoy!

## Overwrite

I will work on making actual mappacks instead of overwriting the default when I figure out how.

## Backup info

File type: `(*.zip)`

Backup size is below 400 kilobytes when compressed, when uncompressed, it is a little over 2000 kilobytes (2.0 MiB)

**Opening in Ubuntu software from my applications menu in GNOME settings gives me this info, which is a different game (as it is not installed) I didn't notice for a while. This info may not be correct. For some reason, Ubuntu shows details for other apps when going to view info/uninstall current installed apps.

## Other notes

Nintendo is usually very harsh when it comes to fan games. This is the only game I know of that uses Nintendo branding that hasn't been taken down. I don't think it will ever be taken down, as it has been up for nearly 9 years now.
